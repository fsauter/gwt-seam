= What's about? =

Seam provides an integration layer that allows GWT widgets to interact directly with Seam components. But GWT 2.0.0 changed some details in its RPC protocol and built-in Seam support for GWT stopped working with errors (e.g. IncompatibleRemoteServiceException). 

gwt-seam helps exactly here.
