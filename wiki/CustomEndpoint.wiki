#summary Description how to setup your endpoint

= Custom endpoint =

By default you have to use ../seam/resource/gwtp as endpoint but you can also define a custom resource endpoint.

Create a `gwtseam.properties` with the following property:
{{{
gwt.rpc.endpoint=dispatcher
}}}

Your service:
{{{
...
@RemoteServiceRelativePath("../seam/resource/dispatcher")
public interface GreetingService extends RemoteService {
        String greetServer(String name) throws IllegalArgumentException;
}
}}}

*Note:* The property file must be placed into the jar of your ear.

Example project structure:
{{{
helloworld.ear
  |+ helloworld.war // Contains web pages etc.
  |+ helloworld.jar // Contains Seam components
    |+ META-INF/
    |+ gwtseam.properties
    |+ seam.properties
    |+ com
      |+ ....
}}}
