#summary Getting Started with GWT RPC

 # Copy (override) gwt-servlet.jar to EAR project, lib folder. (this jar is from gwt and not from seam)
 # download gwt-seam-seperate-x.zip from the download section 
 # Add gwt-seam-service.jar to 
   * your lib folder 
   * the build path
   * the deployed ear jars
 # Change all service endpoints to seam/resource/*gwtp* 
{{{
GreetingServiceAsync serviceAsync = GWT.create(GreetingService.class);
ServiceDefTarget serviceDefTarget = (ServiceDefTarget) serviceAsync;
serviceDefTarget.setServiceEntryPoint(GWT.getHostPageBaseURL() + "seam/resource/gwtp");


}}}
 # Redeploy your project now and you should never see the `IncompatibleRemoteServiceException` ever again!


Note: Radovan Sninsk√Ω and Virgo created the quick fix which is included in the gwt-seam.jar:
