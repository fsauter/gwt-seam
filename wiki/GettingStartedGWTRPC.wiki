#summary Getting Started with GWT RPC

 # Make sure your web.xml contains the `SeamResourceServlet`

{{{
   <servlet>
      <servlet-name>Seam Resource Servlet</servlet-name>
      <servlet-class>org.jboss.seam.servlet.SeamResourceServlet</servlet-class>
   </servlet>

   <servlet-mapping>
      <servlet-name>Seam Resource Servlet</servlet-name>
      <url-pattern>/seam/resource/*</url-pattern>
   </servlet-mapping>
}}}

 # Copy (override) gwt-servlet.jar to EAR project, lib folder. (this jar is from gwt and not from seam)
 # download gwt-seam-seperate-x.zip from the download section 
 # Add gwt-seam-service.jar to 
   * your lib folder 
   * the build path
   * the deployed ear jars
 # Change all service endpoints to seam/resource/*gwtp* 
{{{
...
@RemoteServiceRelativePath("../seam/resource/gwtp")
public interface GreetingService extends RemoteService {
	String greetServer(String name) throws IllegalArgumentException;
}
}}}
 # Redeploy your project now and you should never see the `IncompatibleRemoteServiceException` ever again!


_Note: Radovan Sninsk√Ω and Virgo created the quick fix which is included in the gwt-seam.jar:
