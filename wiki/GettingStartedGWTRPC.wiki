#summary Getting Started with GWT RPC

Radovan Sninsk√Ω and Virgo created a quick fix which is included in the gwt-seam.jar:

Follow the steps on Virgos blog. But instead of downloading the provided zip do following:

 # download gwt-seam-seperate-x.zip from the download section 
 # Add gwt-seam-service.jar to 
   * your lib folder 
   * the build path
   * the deployed ear jars
 # Change all service endpoints to seam/resource/*gwtp* 
 # Redeploy your project now and you should never see the `IncompatibleRemoteServiceException` ever again!
