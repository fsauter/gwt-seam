 # Make sure your web.xml contains the `SeamResourceServlet`
{{{
   <servlet>
      <servlet-name>Seam Resource Servlet</servlet-name>
      <servlet-class>org.jboss.seam.servlet.SeamResourceServlet</servlet-class>
   </servlet>

   <servlet-mapping>
      <servlet-name>Seam Resource Servlet</servlet-name>
      <url-pattern>/seam/resource/*</url-pattern>
   </servlet-mapping>
}}}
 # Download gwt-seam-seperate-x.zip from the download section 
 # If you are using a seam-gen generated project you must do the following:
{{{
MyGWTSeamProject
  |+ ....
  |+ lib
    |+ ....
    |+ gwt-servlet.jar //replace this with your GWT SDK gwt-servlet.jar
    |+ gwt-seam-service.jar
    |+ ....
  |+ resources
    |+ ....
    |+ gwtseam.properties //custom endpoint - see below
    |+ ....
  |+ ....
  |+ deployed-jars-ear.list //add gwt-servlet.jar and gwt-seam.jar
}}}
   * So in fact, all you have to do is update gwt-servlet.jar, copy gwt-seam-service.jar into your lib folder and add these to jars to the  deployed ear jars list. This setup should also work for Eclipse generated Seam Web projects.
 # Change all service endpoints to seam/resource/*gwtp* unless you've set your own CustomEndpoint.
{{{
...
@RemoteServiceRelativePath("../seam/resource/gwtp")
public interface GreetingService extends RemoteService {
	String greetServer(String name) throws IllegalArgumentException;
}
}}}
 # Redeploy your project now and you should never see the `IncompatibleRemoteServiceException` ever again!


_Note: Radovan Sninsk√Ω and Virgo created the quick fix which is included in the gwt-seam.jar:
