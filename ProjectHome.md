# GWT 2.x (and GWTP) & Seam 2.x Integration for JBoss AS #



## Why? ##

Seam provides an integration layer that allows GWT widgets to interact directly with Seam components. But GWT 2.0.0 changed some details in its RPC protocol and built-in Seam support for GWT stopped working with errors (e.g. `IncompatibleRemoteServiceException`).

gwt-seam helps exactly here.

Have a look at the following Getting started sites:

  * [Getting Started with GWT RPC](GettingStartedGWTRPC.md)
  * [Getting Started with GWTP Dispatch](GettingStartedGWTPDispatch.md)

The setups are only well tested with seam-gen generated projects.

## Useful stuff ##

For the translation of your hibernate beans have also a look at:

  * [Beanlib](http://beanlib.sourceforge.net/)
  * [Gilead](http://noon.gilead.free.fr/gilead/index.php?page=gwt)
  * [Errai](http://www.jboss.org/errai)
